  <h1>My favorite thing</h1>
  <p>My favorite thing to do is play video games, commonly known as gaming.  I enjoy gaming for multiple reasons. It is what I do to unwind at the end of the day and relax.  Also, it helps with eye/hand cooridation and response time.  And lastly, playing online games allows me to stay in touch with distant friends.</p>
